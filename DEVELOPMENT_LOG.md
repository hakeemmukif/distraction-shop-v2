# Development Log - Distraction Shop v2.0

## 2025-10-12

### [Initial Setup] Project Foundation & Admin Panel
**Files Created/Modified:**
- Complete Next.js 14 project structure
- Authentication system (login, logout, me endpoints)
- Prisma schema (users, sessions tables)
- Admin panel layouts and dashboards
- Product management UI with Cloudinary integration
- Secure API routes with JWT middleware

**Implementation Details:**

#### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies
- bcrypt password hashing (cost factor: 12)
- Protected route middleware for `/admin` and `/superadmin`
- Role-based access control (admin, superadmin)
- Database seed script for initial superadmin user

**Default Credentials:**
- Email: `superadmin@distractionshop.com`
- Password: `ChangeMe123!` (MUST CHANGE after first login)

#### Admin Panel Features
- **Product Management:**
  - Create products with 3 images (Cloudinary upload)
  - Edit products (name, description, price, category, sizes, stock)
  - Delete products (soft delete via Stripe API)
  - Category filtering (home, skate_shop, preloved)
  - Size and stock management per product

- **API Routes:**
  - `POST /api/admin/products` - Create product
  - `PUT /api/admin/products/:id` - Update product
  - `DELETE /api/admin/products/:id` - Delete product (set active=false)
  - `GET /api/products?category=home` - Fetch products (public)

- **Cloudinary Integration:**
  - Upload widget for 3 images per product
  - Image validation (max 5MB, jpg/png/webp)
  - Square cropping (1:1 aspect ratio)
  - Preview and remove uploaded images
  - Automatic folder organization (distraction-products/)

#### Security Features
- All Stripe API calls server-side only (no secret keys in client)
- Webhook signature verification for payment events
- CSRF protection (SameSite: strict cookies)
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting ready (via middleware)

**Technical Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router, Turbopack)
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Prisma ORM
- Stripe API
- Cloudinary (next-cloudinary)
- React Hook Form + Zod
- bcrypt + jsonwebtoken

**Architecture Decisions:**
1. **No products in database** - Stripe API is source of truth
2. **Minimal database** - Only users and sessions (reduces cost, complexity)
3. **3 images per product** - Stored as Cloudinary URLs in Stripe metadata
4. **Size/stock in metadata** - `size_1`, `size_1_stock`, `size_2`, `size_2_stock`, etc.

**Related Context:**
- See REQUIREMENTS.md for complete system specifications
- See README.md for setup instructions
- GitHub: https://github.com/hakeemmukif/distraction-shop-v2

**Status:** ✅ Completed
